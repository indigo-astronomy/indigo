How to Use
==========

	You can use the SkyWatcher Protocol INDI Driver in any INDI-compatible client such as KStars or Xephem. 
	
	To run the driver from the command line:
	

	$ indiserver indi_eqmod_telescope

	You can then connect to the driver from any client, the default port is 7624.
	If you're using KStars, the driver will be automatically listed in KStars' Device Manager,
	no further configuration is necessary.

	To connect your mount, first specify the serial port in the options Tab (default is /dev/ttyUSB0).
	The mount is supposed to be parked in the home position (pointing to the celestial pole) 
	at the first connection, or after each reset of the mount.
