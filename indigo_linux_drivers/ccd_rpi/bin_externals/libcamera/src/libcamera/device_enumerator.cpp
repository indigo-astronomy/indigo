 * \brief Enumeration and matching of media devices
 *
 * The purpose of device enumeration and matching is to find media devices in
 * the system and map them to pipeline handlers.
 *
 * At the core of the enumeration is the DeviceEnumerator class, responsible
 * for enumerating all media devices in the system. It handles all interactions
 * with the operating system in a platform-specific way. For each media device
 * found an instance of MediaDevice is created to store information about the
 * device gathered from the kernel through the Media Controller API.
 *
 * The DeviceEnumerator can enumerate all or specific media devices in the
 * system. When a new media device is added the enumerator creates a
 * corresponding MediaDevice instance.
 *
 * The enumerator supports searching among enumerated devices based on criteria
 * expressed in a DeviceMatch object.

/**
 * \class DeviceMatch
 * \brief Description of a media device search pattern
 *
 * The DeviceMatch class describes a media device using properties from the
 * Media Controller struct media_device_info, entity names in the media graph
 * or other properties that can be used to identify a media device.
 *
 * The description is meant to be filled by pipeline managers and passed to a
 * device enumerator to find matching media devices.
 *
 * A DeviceMatch is created with a specific Linux device driver in mind,
 * therefore the name of the driver is a required property. One or more Entity
 * names can be added as match criteria.
 *
 * Pipeline handlers are recommended to add entities to DeviceMatch as
 * appropriate to ensure that the media device they need can be uniquely
 * identified. This is useful when the corresponding kernel driver can produce
 * different graphs, for instance as a result of different driver versions or
 * hardware configurations, and not all those graphs are suitable for a pipeline
 * handler.
