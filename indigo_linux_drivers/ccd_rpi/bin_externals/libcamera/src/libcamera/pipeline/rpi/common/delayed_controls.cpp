/**
 * \class DelayedControls
 * \brief Helper to deal with controls that take effect with a delay
 *
 * Some sensor controls take effect with a delay as the sensor needs time to
 * adjust, for example exposure and analog gain. This is a helper class to deal
 * with such controls and the intended users are pipeline handlers.
 *
 * The idea is to extend the concept of the buffer depth of a pipeline the
 * application needs to maintain to also cover controls. Just as with buffer
 * depth if the application keeps the number of requests queued above the
 * control depth the controls are guaranteed to take effect for the correct
 * request. The control depth is determined by the control with the greatest
 * delay.
