/**
 * \class FrameSink
 * \brief Abstract class to model a consumer of frames
 *
 * The FrameSink class models the consumer that processes frames after a request
 * completes. It receives requests through processRequest(), and processes them
 * synchronously or asynchronously. This allows frame sinks to hold onto frames
 * for an extended period of time, for instance to display them until a new
 * frame arrives.
 *
 * A frame sink processes whole requests, and is solely responsible for deciding
 * how to handle different frame buffers in case multiple streams are captured.

/**

 *
 * This function is called to instruct the sink to process a request. The sink
 * may process the request synchronously or queue it for asynchronous
 * processing.
 *
 * When the request is processed synchronously, this function shall return true.
 * The \a request shall not be accessed by the FrameSink after the function
 * returns.
 *
 * When the request is processed asynchronously, the FrameSink temporarily takes
 * ownership of the \a request. The function shall return false, and the
 * FrameSink shall emit the requestProcessed signal when the request processing
 * completes. If the stop() function is called before the request processing
 * completes, it shall release the request synchronously.
 *
 * \return True if the request has been processed synchronously, false if
 * processing has been queued
