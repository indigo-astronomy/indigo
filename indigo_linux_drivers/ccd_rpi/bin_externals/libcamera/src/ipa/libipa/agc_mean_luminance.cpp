/**
 * \class AgcMeanLuminance
 * \brief A mean-based auto-exposure algorithm
 *
 * This algorithm calculates an exposure time, analogue and digital gain such
 * that the normalised mean luminance value of an image is driven towards a
 * target, which itself is discovered from tuning data. The algorithm is a
 * two-stage process.
 *
 * In the first stage, an initial gain value is derived by iteratively comparing
 * the gain-adjusted mean luminance across the entire image against a target,
 * and selecting a value which pushes it as closely as possible towards the
 * target.
 *
 * In the second stage we calculate the gain required to drive the average of a
 * section of a histogram to a target value, where the target and the boundaries
 * of the section of the histogram used in the calculation are taken from the
 * values defined for the currently configured AeConstraintMode within the
 * tuning data. This class provides a helper function to parse those tuning data
 * to discover the constraints, and so requires a specific format for those
 * data which is described in \ref parseTuningData(). The gain from the first
 * stage is then clamped to the gain from this stage.
 *
 * The final gain is used to adjust the effective exposure value of the image,
 * and that new exposure value is divided into exposure time, analogue gain and
 * digital gain according to the selected AeExposureMode. This class uses the
 * \ref ExposureModeHelper class to assist in that division, and expects the
 * data needed to initialise that class to be present in tuning data in a
 * format described in \ref parseTuningData().
 *
 * In order to be able to use this algorithm an IPA module needs to be able to
 * do the following:
 *
 * 1. Provide a luminance estimation across an entire image.
 * 2. Provide a luminance Histogram for the image to use in calculating
 *    constraint compliance. The precision of the Histogram that is available
 *    will determine the supportable precision of the constraints.
 *
 * IPA modules that want to use this class to implement their AEGC algorithm
 * should derive it and provide an overriding estimateLuminance() function for
 * this class to use. They must call parseTuningData() in init(), and must also
 * call setLimits() and resetFrameCounter() in configure(). They may then use
 * calculateNewEv() in process(). If the limits passed to setLimits() change for
 * any reason (for example, in response to a FrameDurationLimit control being
 * passed in queueRequest()) then setLimits() must be called again with the new
 * values.
