libnexstar
==========

This library implements the serial commands supported by the Celestron
NexStar hand control (HC) and SkyWatcher/Orion SynScan HC. This applies
to the Celestron: NexStar GPS, NexStar GPS-SA, NexStar iSeries, NexStar
SE Series, NexStar GT, CPC, SLT, Advanced-VX, Advanced-GT, CGE, CGEM etc.
SkyWatcher: EQ5, HEQ5, EQ6 (Pro), AZ-EQ5 GT, AZ-EQ6 GT, EQ8 etc. and the
corresponding Orion mounts.

Communication to the hand control is 9600 bits/sec, no parity and one
stop bit via the RS-232 port on the base of the hand control.

Communication can be established over TCP/IP if nexbridge is running
on the computer connected to the telescope.

NOTE: For SkyWatcher/Orion mounts it is highly recommended to enforce
protocol version checking (see enforce_protocol_version()) as the AUX
commands are not supported or may behave erratically.
