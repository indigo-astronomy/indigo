Library for controlling Moravian Instruments (MI) CCD cameras.

Copyright 2016, Moravian Instruments Inc <http://www.gxccd.com>
All rights reserved.

This library can be used to control MI CCD cameras connected over USB or Ethernet.
The library documentation is located in file gxxcd.h in include directory.

You should have a recent kernel, glibc and libusb library. Library should work
with glibc 2.4 or newer.
When using the static version (libgxccd.a) in your project, you must link
it against math (libm), realtime (librt), pthreads (libpthread) and usb (libusb-1.0)
libraries, for example:

    $ cc -o test test.c -lpthread -lrt -lm -lusb-1.0 libgxccd.a

To see and use a test program, go to example directory, and (if you have make
and C compiler installed), run make. Then run produced binary file
(gxccd-test).
