-- 2.0.0: THE release, ready for distribution. Documentation is still
   missing, but will eventually be completed.

-- (various RCs): many interface changes

-- 2.0.0-rc6:
   Yes, more changes. We are waiting for one last big change before the
   release of 2.0.0 so this may be the last RC.

-- 2.0.0-rc5:
   More interface changes, PIO support, cleanup and fixes.

-- 2.0.0-rc4:
   Intermediate release that includes a.o. the new capture API, better
   support for AVT cameras, conversion functions that work on the new
   video buffer struct, etc...

-- 2.0.0-rc3:
   The major addition of this version is the compatibility with Mac OSX
   (Yeah!) There's a bunch of fixes and additions here and there too.

-- 2.0.0-rc2:
   Fixed serious problems in the camera detection

-- 2.0.0-rc1:
   This is the first RC release. Enjoy or send bug reports to the list.

-- 2.0.0-pre7:
   Many significant changes.

-- 2.0.0-pre6:
   Don't package anything before a final release (or at least a release
   candidate), _please_. These PRE versions have an API that will change
   and are not suitable for packages. This should be the last PRE release.
   If there is no problem with it we will switch to release candidates (RC)
   soon.

-- 2.0.0-pre5:
   The development continues... Besides bug fixes, the most notable
   improvement is the capture structure that is now hidden in the camera
   struct.

-- 2.0.0-pre4:
   bug fixes

-- 2.0.0-pre3:
   This release appears to be fully functional. It can be used but has not
   been extensively tested.

-- 2.0.0-pre2:
   Same warning as pre1

-- 2.0.0-pre1:
   A lot of changes, see the changelog for more details. This version breaks
   almost all compatibility with the main trunk. Known not to work properly.
   You have been warned ;-) This is just a CVS snapshot of the Version_2_0
   branch.

(Older news about versions 0.x and 1.x of the library can be found in the
respective 0.x and 1.x packages)
