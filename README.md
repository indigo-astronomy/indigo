# INDIGO is the next generation of INDI, based on layered architecture and software bus.

This is the list of requirements taken into the consideration:

1. No GPL dependency to allow commercial use under application stores licenses.
2. ANSI C for portability and to allow simple wrapping into .Net, Java, GOlang, Objective-C or Swift in future
3. Layered architecture to allow direct linking of the drivers into applications and or to replace wire protocol.
4. Atomic approach to device drivers. E.g. if camera has imaging and guiding chip, driver should expose two independent simple devices instead of one complex. It is much easier and transparent for client.
5. Drivers should support hot-plug at least for USB devices. If device is connected/disconnected while driver is running, its properties should appear/disappear on the bus.
6. FITS, XISF, JPEG, TIFF, RAW, AVI and SER format supported directly by the framework.

## This is already done

## How to build INDIGO

### Prerequisites
#### Ubuntu / Debian / Raspbian

`sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf autotools-dev libtool cmake libudev-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libz-dev git curl bsdmainutils`

It is advised to remove libraw1394-dev

`sudo apt-get remove libraw1394-dev`

#### Fedora

`dnf install automake autoconf cmake libtool gcc gcc-c++ libusb-devel avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel libudev-devel git curl curl-devel`

It is advised to remove libraw1394-devel

`dnf remove libraw1394-devel`

#### macOS

Install XCode and download and build autoconf, automake and libtool (use tools/cltools.sh script).

### Get code and build it

`git clone https://github.com/indigo-astronomy/indigo.git`

`cd indigo`

`make all`

`build/bin/indigo_server -v -s`

and connect from any INDIGO/INDI client or web browser to localhost on port 7624...

### No pthread_yield()
New linux distributions come with the latest glibc that does not provide pthread_yield() However libqhy.a depends on it. We do not have control over this library and it is not officially supprted by QHY any more. So if you get complaints by the linker for missing *pthread_yield* call please execute the folowing command in *indigo_drivers/ccd_qhy/bin_externals/pthread_yield_compat/*:

`make patchlib`

and rerun the build
